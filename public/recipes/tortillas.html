<div class="w3-container recipe">
<p>These Easy Chicken Tortillas are a fantastic 'hack meal' - simply pop your favourite fillings onto separate segments of the wrap, make a cut to the centre, fold and toast.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prep time: 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Cook time: 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Total time: 15 minutes</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>4 large tortillas</li>
    <li>1 large avocado</li>
    <li>40g baby spinach</li>
    <li>4 Tbsp cream cheese or sour cream</li>
    <li>200g cooked chicken breast</li>
    <li>4 Tbsp tomato salsa</li>
    <li>50g corn chips</li>
    <li>80g grated cheese</li>
  </ul>
<h3>To serve</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sour cream</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place a tortilla on the bench or a chopping board. Using a knife or scissors, make a cut from the centre to the edge, like the first cut in a cake.</li>
    <li>Working your way from the cut mark, fill the four quarters of the tortilla with the following fillings: Avocado and spinach, sour cream and cooked chicken, salsa and corn chips, grated cheese.</li>
    <li>When all four quarters are full, it's time to fold. Start with the avocado quarter and fold up onto the salsa and corn chips. Then fold over to the chicken quarter, then finally on to the cheese quarter. This will ensure the cheese melts and the chicken gets warmed through. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and ingredients.</li>
    <li>Place the folded tortillas into a hot sandwich press and cook until the cheese starts to melt and the outside is golden.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately with sour cream or spicy mayo.</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>This is a great way to use up leftover roast chicken. If you don't have a sandwich press you can cook them for a few minutes on each side in a frying pan.</p>
