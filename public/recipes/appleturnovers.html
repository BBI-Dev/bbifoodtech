</ul>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 sheets ready-rolled puff pastry, partially thawed</li>
    <li>1 can of apple slices (or fruit of your choice)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>&frac12; tsp ground cinnamon </li>
    <li>1 tsp cornflour</li>
    <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
    <li>Whipped cream, to serve</li>
  </ul>
  
<h2>Method:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C, fan bake. Line a baking tray with baking paper. You will need two trays if you are using more than two sheets of puff pastry.</li>
    <li>Cut each sheet of puff pastry into quarters.</li>
    <li>Combine cinnamon and sugar in a bowl. Stir gently to combine. </li>
    <li>Place apple slices (or fruit slices) in a bowl or on a chopping board and cut up into little pieces.</li>
    <li>Stir through the cornflour and mix in a teaspoon of the cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
    <li>Place the apple/fruit mixture  over 1 half of each pastry square, leaving a 1cm border. If the slices are still too large, cut them into small pieces.</li>
    <li>Fold pastry over filling to enclose (I like to fold the square into a triangle).  Using a fork, press the edge to seal and use a sharp knife to make two cuts in the top of the pastry.</li>
    <li>Place turnovers on prepared trays. Brush turnover tops with milk and sprinkle with leftover sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake for 15 minutes. You might want to swap or turn the trays around half way.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Serve warm with cream or dust with some icing sugar.</li>
  </ol>
